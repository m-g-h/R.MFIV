\title{CBOE Option selection scheme
\loadmathjax
This function performs the selection of out-of-the-money options as explained in the
\href{https://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf}{VIX whitepaper}:
\emph{"Select out-of-the-money put options with strike prices \mjseqn{< K_0}. Start with the put strike
immediately lower than K0 and move to successively lower strike prices. Exclude any put option
that has a bid price equal to zero (i.e., no bid). As shown below, once two puts with consecutive
strike prices are found to have zero bid prices, no puts with lower strikes are considered for inclusion."}
The same principle applies to call options in ascending direction.}
\usage{
CBOE_option_selection(nested, K_0)
}
\arguments{
\item{nested}{A \code{data.table} or "nest" with three columns:
\itemize{
\item K (\code{numeric}, strike price in ascending order)
\item c (\code{numeric}, call option price)
\item p (\code{numeric}, put option price)
}}

\item{K_0}{\code{numeric scalar}, giving the theoretical at-the-money strike price}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{data.table} with two columns:
\itemize{
\item K (\code{numeric}, strike price in ascending order)
\item c (\code{numeric}, out-of-the money option prices)
}
}
